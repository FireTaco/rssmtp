Use your mail client as your RSS reader

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/elliotf/rssmtp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/elliotf/rssmtp)

## Why?

* Google reader is shutting down
* Getting your feed in your email means offline is free (other than images)
* You don't have to think about installing an additional piece of software
* You can share easily by forwarding the email you receive
* Other rss to email gateways require yet another password or cost or something else
