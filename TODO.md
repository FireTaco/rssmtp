# Development TODO

* add an Article factory to Feed (addArticleFromData or some such) to reduce cruft around building articles
* Implement Feed up to the level that Poller requires
* Sort out Feed's fetch/pull/merge/publish so it makes more sense
* Remove refetch from UI
* Show some sort of UI for showing users, feeds, subscribed
* Debug information for poller in console/log
