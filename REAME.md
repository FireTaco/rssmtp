# rss-email-gw

Use your mail client as your RSS reader

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/elliotf/rss-email-gw.png)](http://travis-ci.org/elliotf/rss-email-gw)

## Why

* Because google reader is shutting down
* Because a feed reader looks a heck of a lot like a mail client -- why not make your mail client your feed reader?
* Because other rss to email gateways require yet another password or cost or whatever

## Why not rss2email?

* I'd rather have it run on a server with a web interface that my wife can use
* I'm experimenting
