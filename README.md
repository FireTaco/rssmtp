# rssmtp

Use your mail client as your RSS reader

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/elliotf/rssmtp.png)](http://travis-ci.org/elliotf/rssmtp)

## Why?

* Google reader is shutting down
* Other rss to email gateways require yet another password or cost or something else
* I'm experimenting

## Why not rss2email?

* I'd rather have it run on a server with a web interface that my wife can use it without having to wait for me
